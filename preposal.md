## Do you have any questions of your own?
How much should we push ourselves our of our comfort zones? I have a bunch of ideas but realize there is a learning curve to all of them. 
Should we pick something we know we can defintely finish and know for sure is in my realm of capabilites or pick something a little out of my comfort zone 
to try and learn something new even though I may not be able to finish the project in time or be able to figure it out with my current skill set.
